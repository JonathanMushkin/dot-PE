## Purpose

DOT-PE is a Python package for parameter estimation and evidence integration using data from the gravitational wave interferometer observatories LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on stochastic samplers, DOT-PE performs parameter estimation and evidence integration using matrix multiplications for fast likelihood evaluation. All interfacing with gravitational wave data, waveform generation, and sampling tools is handled through the [`cogwheel`](https://github.com/jroulet/cogwheel) package.
